# Using ViewTransitions with SVG elements
This is a small code sample to showcase how using ViewTransitions works with elements of an SVG.

Note the use of `navigate()` in [the clickable SVG circle](src/components/Svg.astro). Commenting out the `<script></script>` block will cause transitions to be broken and a full browser refresh occuring every time we click on the circle.
